# Convert Vimeo's .vtt Closed Caption Files to a Human-Readable Transcript

Vimeo automatically transcribes your video and creates closed captions for it. You can download the subtitles as a .vtt file, but this isn't useful if you need a human-readable transcript.

Subtitle files are designed to pack as many words onto one or two lines as possible, which often means splitting paragraphs in two, which makes it hard to read.

This page converts Vimeo's .vtt subtitle files to a readable transcript file.
